# Codified Knowledge

This repo collects github gists I've made to help with coding instruction. As a young developer who's had the opportunity to be an educator, I encourage as often as possible diving into a topic conceptually rather than just memorizing syntax. Generally, these gists do just that.

Many of what's collected here, I wrote in answer to specific student questions, so certain things are of limited scope and deal with specific technologies with which students were working. Other gists reflect my feedback to students and cover topics I've seen be hard to grasp initially.
